This workshop provide an introduction into reverse engineering of binary applications. It is designed as a “hands-on” event that provides a general introduction to this topic by reversing several small “crackmes”.

During the workshop, participants will use IDA (Free version) and a debugger to perform static/dynamic analysis of the binaries.

## Course outline:
- Introduction 
- Tool Overview (Command Line Tools, IDA, GDB with pwndbg, RetDec Decompiler, Hex Editors)
- x86/x64 Assembler Crash Course
- Function Calls and Calling Conventions 
- Debugging Symbols and Binary Stripping 
- Common Code Patterns and their Assembly Counterparts
- Binary patching
- Pratical Exercises and Crackmes


## Requirements:
Participants must bring a Laptop that is capable of running a Linux VM (2 GB RAM, 6 GB HD). VMware and Virtual Box are supported. Having a two-button mouse helps but is not required.
