    bio:  "Dr. Morton Swimmer is a manager in the Forward-Looking Threat Research (FTR) team at Trend Micro, Inc. where he peers into the future of computers and society to identify the risks and vulnerabilities of the future. His past in computer security stretches back 30 years and he has been involved in most of the innovations in security, first at the University of Hamburg, Germany, then IBM Research and now Trend Micro. While originally active in malware analysis and computer forensics, recently his team has been focussing on massive threat data analysis for spotting new types of attacks quantitatively and also on modelling future threats to society that will accompany its inevitable march towards tighter integration in smart cities, intelligent transportation, supply chains and manufacturing. Morton, a native of New York City, has a Computer Science PhD degree from the University of Hamburg, and currently resides in the Hamburg, Germany area."

To make threat intelligence data actionable without the risk of the automation backfiring, data must be homogenized, not just syntactically, but also semantically.
Data ontologies are the key to a data representation that allows for reasoning and automation and good design will ensure that goals are reached and interoperability is given.
This workshop will cover best practices for security ontology engineering in OWL2 using open source tools like Protege and software stacks that can be used to convert data to an RDF model and finally use it.
For exercises we will use a cloud-hosted version of Protege.
