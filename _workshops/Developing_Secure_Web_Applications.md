Did you ever want to know how hacking web applications works?
This will be an introduction into vulnerabilities, application pen testing and the security of web applications.
Only if you know how hackers attack your application, you will be able to defend yourself.

Nearly all companies use web applications nowadays.
Any vulnerability in those applications may be an invitation for hackers to attack it.
This workshop will give you insights on those things that you should never neglect when programming your application.

## Course outline:
- A small online 'escape the room'-like teaser to gain insights about some techniques used for attacking web applications e.g. Disabling frontend checks using the Chrome Developer Tools (Hands On)
- An overview of the OWSAP top 10 vulnerabilities
- A hands on session where a vulnerable application shall be exploited using SQL Injection, XSS and File Inclusion attacks
- A hands on session on how to resolve the vulnerabilities

## Requirements
All participants will need a laptop as well as internet connection.
Software development experience is required.
