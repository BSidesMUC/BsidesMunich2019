Wireless systems, and their radio signals, are everywhere: consumer, corporate, government, amateur - widely deployed and often vulnerable.
With the exponential growth of connected devices in the IoT space there are more devices then ever using the airwaves.

This hands-on workshop will teach you how to find, analyse and begin to reverse engineer any signal.
Focus will be on the 433 MHz band a which is non-regulated and commonly used in IoT.

## Course outline:
1. Introduction to software defined radio (SDR) and radio waves. This include some theory on radio waves, bands, modulation, etc
2. Introduction to gnuradio
3. Introduction to RTL-SDR
4. Listening to radio waves with gnuradio - hands-on
5. Capturing and reverse engineering radiowaves with gnuradio
6. Introduction to universal radio hacker (urh)
7. Capturing and reverse engineering radiowaves with urh
8. Hands-on exercises with 433 Mhz using urh and arduino

## Requirements
If you have any SDR equipment, bring it along! I’ll bring some equipment with me. 
You will need a modern laptop with Linux or have the possibility to setup to run a VM with access to USB ports (8 GB RAM and ~50 GB on the HDD).

All the software tools needed are provided in a VM and I will bring 10 hardware kits for all the hands-on part.
So it can have up to 20 people by making groups of 2.
These kits will lent to the participants, and can be sold to those interested.
