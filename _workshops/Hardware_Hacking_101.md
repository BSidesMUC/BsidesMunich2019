The Hardware Hacking workshop is aimed to provide a solid base for everyone who would like to start with hardware hacking but does not know where to begin. The participants will learn how to approach unknown hardware, find and connect to debug ports as well as the process of turning documentation information into an offensive context which is also part of practical assignments during the training. Participants dealing with a mixed bag of theory with a hands-on hacking experience. 

After the workshop the participant will have enough knowledge to continue hardware hacking on their own. It will also be a good base for further research on the topic. 

There is no hardware hacking knowledge required from the attendees. However, good knowledge of computer science and linux command line is highly beneficial to complete assignments. 

Let's pwn that Router together!
