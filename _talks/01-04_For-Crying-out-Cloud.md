Is your business moving into the Cloud?
Is it thinking of moving into the Cloud?
Or is it already in the Cloud, but perhaps hasn’t yet matured the security of what it has in the Cloud?
The presenters work for a multi-brand organisation where their applications and over 9 petabytes of personal data are in the Cloud.
However, up until September 2018, no-one owned or managed the security of AWS across the business.
This was a problem and risk that needed to be rectified! 
When one of the presenters joined the business in May 2018, within a number of months he had seen a major gap and decided to take on this responsibility and build a team to progress the security of the org. 
This presentation is a rundown of that journey so far, what was discovered, our goals and learnings (injecting our normal humour into our talk!) and providing the audience with tangible information to take away to help on their cloud journey.
Regardless of the role or the skill set of the audience member, they will leave with an understanding of what it is like at the coal-face of a major internet business running their applications and storing their data in the Cloud.

### Outline
We will cover the following topics in our talk / presentation flow:
* Background of both of our careers (brief)
* What both presenters found when they joined and why they decided to take on the role (a lack of any ownership of Cloud Security, brands using differing processes, ineffective tooling, visibility and reporting, departing members of staff with considerable cloud knowledge, little automation, basic errors being made, lack of documentation, out of date documentation as soon as it is created ‘threat modelling as code’, complexities of how a multi-brand org actually consumes AWS, mapping out of architectures, compliance challenges)
* Implementing the Cloud ‘basics’ before doing the cool stuff! What did we do first? Why did we choose to do those things? How we have worked to culturally change an already cloud-first business to become a cloud-first, security-first business
* What problems we’re trying to solve; 3/6/12 months strategies/objectives and beyond
* ‘Compliance As Code’ and our journey to get there. What we still have to do.
* Challenges/Learnings - info the audience take away as tangible advice. What might we do differently?
