    bio: "I am an IT professional living near Salzburg/Austria. Participating my first Chaos Communication Congress in 1998 in Berlin got me interested in the field of IT security. Over the years, I was able to contribute to this field, mainly in the area of Bluetooth security.<br>In 2004, I co-founded the trifinite.group - a group of security researchers that - in co-operation with the Bluetooth SIG - for many years helped to improve the device security of many different mobile handset manufacturers at that time.<br>After quitting my job as a researcher in a Salzburg-based public research company, I founded a company named toothR new media GmbH in 2007, which now offers consulting and development services. As part of my consulting work, I am part of the Professional Services Team of Greenbone Networks since 2014."

Since most modern Bluetooth devices are configured to be invisible by default, discovery of these devices is challenging.
Bluetooth threats targeting device integrity, device security and user privacy make the topic relevant.
Especially during the last two years, activity in the Bluetooth security field has increased. 
The presentation introduces several effective approaches on finding targets for further analysis.
