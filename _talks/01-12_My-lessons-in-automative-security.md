I will present problems or obstacles that the automotive industry faces when building cars and connected cars.

### Outline
I would present insights into how cars are developed from my point of view after 3+ years as a pentester in the automotive industry.
Details that were new to me coming from a very software centric view of security, including hardware security.
What are the problems that OEMs face coming from a very mechanic industry towards a software centric (cyber physical) industry?
What are problems in different markets?
There are some things that are different coming from a network and web app pentesting background.
The idea was to inform what we do and what might be interesting for you if *you* were to join this industry.
I would in the end get interactive and have an open discussion about expectations of the audience towards manufacturers.
