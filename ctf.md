###We saved the cat!

2019 was the first time that BSidesMunich offered a CTF as part of the event. It was full of monkeys, lions, dogs, cats and locks. There were good things, challenging things and things-to-improve. Overall though, the feedback has been positive, and we hope that participants had a good time!
